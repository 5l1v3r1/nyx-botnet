NYX Botnet
==========
We wrote a botnet for class. C&C xD<br>
For this to run you need to create a file called app.vars and put anything on the first line. That's the secret key for the app. Then put something else on the second line. That's the password salt used for password hashing. Then on the third line put the initial user's user name. Use the fourth line for the initial user's password<br>
